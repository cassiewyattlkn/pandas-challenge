    "- In this provided analysis, we have collected multiple sets of data to compare schools, grade level, budget, count of students, math and reading scores, as well as other items. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Comparisons were brought to light while sifting this data. One camparison brought to light is the higher scoring student who attend charter schools versus district schools. Referring to the top 5 and bottom 5 performing schools, Higher rated schools were all charter and lower rated schools were all district.\n",
    "- While thinking budget per student could play a role on education value, another trend recognized was that spending per student is not a factor for higher grades. The opposite actually occured where students where spending was lower, the average overall passing % was higher than all else.\n",
